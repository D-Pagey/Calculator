## JavaScript Calculator -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- [x] I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- [x] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

This is the 1st of the Advanced Front End projects on FreeCodeCamp and it involved working with more user inputs than prior projects. In the future, I would like to come back to this project and restyle it, maybe add some animations for the buttons as well as have slightly different styles for different devices. Overall, this was a really interesting and challenging project.
