## JavaScript Calculator -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- [x] I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- [x] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal
 button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

This is the 1st of the Advanced Front End projects on FreeCodeCamp and it
involved working with more user inputs than prior projects. In the future, I
would like to come back to this project and restyle it, maybe add some
animations for the buttons as well as have slightly different styles for
different devices. Overall, this was a really interesting and challenging
project.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla
JS version but not in the React version.
- DRY on the number buttons
- Organise the components better

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
