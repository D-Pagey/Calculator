## JavaScript Calculator -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- [x] I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- [x] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal
 button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

The Reactifying of this Calculator projects wasn't too difficult. The main issue
has only been around the code getting verbose. I need to refactor and tidy it up
as I feel like it's a bit of a mess at the moment. I've hit all the user stories
but I do need to come back to this project and sort out all the improvements.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla
JS version but not in the React version.
- DRY on the number buttons.
- Organise the components better.
- Restyle the calculator.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`
