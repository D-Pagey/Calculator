## JavaScript Calculator -  A Free Code Camp project

This is the 1st of the "Advanced" projects in the old FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 
The vanilla JS version was interesting as all the logic was in one javascript 
file and so organising it and understanding it was a slight challenge. 
Separating this out in the React version made things a lot simpler. 

Also, in the vanilla version I used global variables (which I know are bad),
however in the React version I could simply stick all variables in state. 

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- [x] I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- [x] I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal
 button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

**Main Lessons Learnt:**
* Dealing with more complex logic

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start`
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this

*This project was retired in June 2018.*
